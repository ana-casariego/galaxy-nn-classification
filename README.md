# Galaxy Classification and Neural Networks 

This was an in class Kaggle Competition which I took part in. The goal of the competition was to build a model that classifies the probability that a galaxy image belongs in a particular galaxy morphology classification. 

There were 4 people in my team and we would not have been succesful without each other's support.
